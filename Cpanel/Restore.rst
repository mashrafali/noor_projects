Alternatively, if you are the server administrator you can login to the server via SSH as root, and run the following command in the shell:

{{{
# /scripts/restorepkg username
# /scripts/restorepkg elsewedy
}}}
Where '''username''' is the name of the user that you want to restore.

 . You donâ€™t have to create an account prior to restore as the account will be automatically created if it does not exist. All the user files and folders including databases will be restored to the correct locations. There is not need to untar or extract the backup file.
