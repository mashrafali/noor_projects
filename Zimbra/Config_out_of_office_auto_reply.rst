= Configure out of office auto reply =

When you are in a vacation, it is a good practice to inform mail senders that you are out of office and inform them about your return date. <<BR>>

To configure Out-of-Office auto-reply feature, please do the following:  <<BR>>

1- Access your webmail through this URL: http://smtp.noor.net <<BR>>

2- Login using your username@noor.net and password <<BR>>

3- Click on “Preferences” tab, then click on “Mail” submenu on the left side. <<BR>>

4- Under “Receiving Messages”, check the “Send auto-reply message” option. <<BR>>

5- Write your auto-reply message in the white rectangle. <<BR>>

'''Example of a good auto-reply message is:''' <<BR>>
{{{
Thank you for your message. I am currently out of the office with [limited][no] access to e-mail.

I will be returning on [date]

(Optional) If you need urgent assistance, please [return to my team mates][call me on my mobile]

[Signature]
}}}

6- If you know your vacation start and end dates, check the “Start on: ” and “End On: ” options and enter the appropriate dates. Otherwise you will need to uncheck the “Send auto-reply message” option when you return from your vacation.
 <<BR>>
